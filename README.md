## Scope Agent

Important tricks and ideas:
- The structure of the workflow is super simple: to clarify the request with user and to finish, or to write a research brief and to finish

The schema:

## Research Agent

Important tricks and ideas:
- To use `think_tool`, so that the agent can 
- To use the workflow structure that allows an agent to return to search as much as it needed (up to some predefined limit)
- To use very specific prompts that guide the execution of every LLM call. The prompts are very detailed and contain additional examples.

## Research Agent MCP

Basically, it is the same as a regular research agent described earlier, but with async tool execution and MCP configuration.


## Research Supervisor

Important tricks and ideas:
- long context is bad
-
